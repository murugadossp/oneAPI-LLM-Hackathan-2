      "Contempt of court refers to the offense of disobeying or disrespecting a court of law and its procedures or orders. In India, contempt of court is classified into civil contempt and criminal contempt under the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971. Civil contempt involves wilful disobedience to any judgment, decree, direction, order, writ or other process of a court or wilful breach of an undertaking given to a court. Criminal contempt, on the other hand, includes the publication of any matter or the doing of any other act whatsoever which scandalizes or tends to scandalize or lowers or tends to lower the authority of any court, prejudices or interferes or tends to interfere with the due course of any judicial proceeding, or interferes or tends to interfere with or obstructs or tends to obstruct the administration of justice in any other manner. Examples of contempt of court include rude and contumelious behavior, obstinacy, perverseness, prevarication, refusal to answer any lawful question, breach of the peace, or any wilful disturbance.

In the Indian legal system, contempt of court is classified into civil contempt and criminal contempt under the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971. Civil contempt refers to the wilful disobedience to any judgment, decree, direction, order, writ, or other process of a court or wilful breach of an undertaking given to a court. Criminal contempt, on the other hand, includes any publication (whether by words, spoken or written, or by signs, or by visible representations, or otherwise) of any matter or the doing of any other act whatsoever which scandalizes or tends to scandalize or lowers or tends to lower the authority of any court, or prejudices, or interferes or tends to interfere with, the due course of any judicial proceeding, or interferes or tends to interfere with, or obstructs or tends to obstruct, the administration of justice in any other manner. Examples of contempt of court include rude and contumelious behavior, obstinacy, perverseness, prevarication, or refusal to answer any lawful question, breach of the peace, or any wilful disturbance, making impertinent threats to a witness, insulting the judge, or calling the trial judge a \"prejudiced judge.\" The punishment for contempt of court may vary depending on the circumstances and the specific provision of law violated.\n",

      "On August 6, 2019, the President of India issued a constitutional order under Article 370, which ceased the operation of most of the provisions of Article 370, making the state's Constitution subject to the Indian Constitution. The order also bifurcated the state into two union territories: Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh. This change was made through the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act, 2019 (34 of 2019), which led to the deletion of Entry 15 relating to Jammu and Kashmir.\n",
